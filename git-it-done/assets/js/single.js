/* Lesson 6.3
In this lesson, we will provide the functionality of the user being able to click on a single repo in the list of repos, 
and be redirected to a new page that will list all of the issues associated with that repo.  In this lesson we will:

1.  Define request and response headers
2.  Use additinal GitHub API endpoints 

For this lesson, we created a new js file named single.js and linked it to the single-repo.html file that was given 

*/

/*6.3.4 Fetch the API data, start by creating a new function named getRepoIssues() that will take in a repo name as a parameter
The API endpoint we've been using (/users/<user>/repos) doesn't provide enough information for us to display the individual 
issues for a single repository.  The steps for fetching API data:

1.  create a variable to store the API's url
2.  use the fetch method and then property to pull data
3.  Check for successful request, if successful, convert respone into JSON format
4.  Convert Fetched Data into DOM elements
5.  Append converted fetched data into a element
6.  Append <a> element to actual page

    The documentation might not make this apparent, but we also have the option to append ?direction=asc to the end of the query 
    URL to specify the sort order. By default, GitHub returns request results in descending order by their created date, meaning 
    that we see newer issues first. The ?direction=asc option reverses order to return older issues first.   Using the endpoint 
    listed in the GitHub documentation for retrieving issues, we can format the URL as follows:

    //the response.  We had to update the fetch() request to receive and handle the server's response:
    //We are building out a basic HTTP reques to hit the issues endpoint.  REMEMBER fetch() is asynchronous, so we'll have to use
    //its Promise based syntax to actually access the data contained in the response b/c waiting for a response
    fetch(apiUrl).then(function(response) {
        // request was successful

            HTTP headers allow the client and the server to pass additional information with an HTTP request or response. This 
            often includes information like whether or not to cache (locally store) data and, if so, for how long. This data goes 
            in the headers because it's often small in file size and not directly pertinent to the content in the body of a request 
            or response.  For example, the very common Content-Type header specifies the format of the requested resource. The 
            GitHub API responses always include a Content-Type value of application/json to signify that the response is formatted 
            as JSON.  You can view the headers on a request or response in DevTools by clicking on the request in the Network tab.

/*
Learned that request and response headers contain additional information about the request, separate from the data 
itselfâ€”like GitHub's Link header that lets you know there are more pages of results to request.

Leveraged a new GitHub API endpoint to request more specific data, using an optional ? string to change how results 
are sorted.
